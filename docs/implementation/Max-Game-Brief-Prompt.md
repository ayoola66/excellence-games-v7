Thanks for pointing some of this out and I am glad that you did. So, do not compromise on your response and recommendation as the success of this project is absolutely paramount to my future success as a Tech Expert and your assistance is paramount.

Also, I must add, I feel a lot overwhelm with some of the tech/stacks/platforms you are mentioning here. Because my tech/coding skills are like minimal. Although, if I am giving a proper give to how-tos, I can follow adequate instruction and work to solutions. I must say I wasn’t expecting some of these things mentioned below. I will make some notes to your questions and suggestion below at this stage.

So these are my points:

---

## **1\. Authentication & User Flows**

* **Email verification & password reset**  
   You’ll need one-time tokens (via emailed links) to confirm new accounts and allow forgotten-password flows.  
  This is good and I really like it. I wish to collect full names, email address, phone numbers and delivery address (for those who are buying the board game which in turns gives them yearly access as that’s what they are paying for). Having said that, I would love that email to be the login via token link that they will have to click to login or for login, they type in an email and they will get a randomised 8 characters that they will have to type into the website within 60sec to login.

* **Session management & idle-timeout handling**  
   Decide whether to store sessions server-side (e.g. Redis) or use JWTs with short expirations plus refresh tokens.  
  What does this mean? And which one is the easiest to manage and cost effective?

* **Multi-device behavior**  
   If a player logs in on two devices at once, do you allow concurrent play? Kick the previous session?  
  No. no. If a user tries to login in another device to create a new session, the previous or live session will automatically be terminated with a warning “More than one active session or game noticed. See you on the other side\!”

## **2\. Data Modeling & Schema**

* **Subscription / entitlements model**

  * Users ↔ Subscriptions (one-to-many, with coupon codes, trial flags, renewal status)  
    Not sure I follow what you are saying here.

  * Entitlements table: which categories each user may access (derive from subscription)  
    Any paid customer will have access to every game on the site one year from payment. If the payment card on file can’t be charge, it pushes automatic disconnection from the site. However, they will still be able to access the one free game.

* **Game sessions**

  * Session entity tracking which questions have been served → support “no repeat until exhaustion” per session  
    Correct. If a user login into another device before the last accessed timed out or they logout, the previous session disconnect immediately and the new session will have to start the question randomisation afresh without remembering the last session questions tracking. Hope this makes sense?

  * Per-card state (flipped, timer remaining)

* **Import schema**

  * Define the CSV/JSON structure: question ID, text, four options, correct-answer key, optional styling flags  
    If I know how to structure the CSV to upload the questions/answers, then I will be be able to set this up. My idea is this and you can tell me if it works and where you can fill in the gap, pls:  
    I am thinking say a particular spreadsheet name is the game category i.e. Christmas-Trivia (dash means it is a space). Each tabs 1-5 or 6 are the cards which will have the questions and answers. In the sheet 1 for possible questions that will show for users that clicked Card 1, it should have in Row1:Column1:QUESTIONS,  Row1:Column2:OPTION1, Row1:Column3:OPTION2, Row1:Column4:OPTION3, Row1:Column5:OPTION4, Row1:Column6:OPTION\_ANSWER. Then, of course from Row2… the actual questions and answers will be filled into the subsequent columns. If there are any other way to lay this out, please let me know. Especially, how best can I show in the CSV for the database to know what option is the correct answer on the CSV so that it can update that on the database and when the Reveal Answer button is clicked, it shows on the game interface itself?

## **3\. Admin CMS & Low-Code Tools**

* **Headless CMS vs. custom UI**  
   A pre-built headless CMS (e.g. Strapi, Keystone) would give you CSV-import plugins, role-based access, rich-text fields—without building every form from scratch.  
  I am guessing this is good? As I don’t know what this is. If it is good, then we go with it.

* **Coupon & pricing management**  
   Need an admin UI to create seasonal vouchers, set their expiration, redemption caps, and tie them into Stripe’s coupon API.  
  This will be amazing if added.

## **4\. Payments & Webhooks**

* **Webhook handling**  
   Stripe (and PayPal) will send asynchronous events (payment\_success, invoice\_failed, customer.subscription.updated) that you must verify and use to grant/revoke access.  
  I guess this won’t be too difficult to do?

* **Retry logic & grace periods**  
   Decide how long after a failed renewal a user stays in paid tier before downgrading to free.  
  One week, after that, if recharge didn’t go through, cut them off.

## **5\. Performance & Scaling**

I am hoping everything here is good to go as I wouldn't know much about here.

* **Load testing target**  
   You anticipate \~500 concurrent players; plan for sudden spikes.

* **Caching**

  * Use Redis (or in-memory) to cache: question pools, session lookups, entitlement checks—to keep latency low during rapid card flips.

* **Database choice & sharding**  
   A relational DB (PostgreSQL) is ideal for subscriptions and relations; consider read replicas or partitioning as you grow.

## **6\. Security & Compliance**

* **GDPR / Privacy**

  * Cookie banner \+ opt-in for tracking  
    Yes, please. If there is a Free option that I can use on the website, please recommend

  * Data-subject request flows (export/delete user data)  
    Hmm, not sure I know this one? 

* **Rate limits & abuse protection**  
   Prevent brute-force logins, API scraping of question pools, or malicious rapid-fire card-reveal loops.  
  Please, yes. Whichever way we can implement this in the easiest and cost effective way, Yes.

## **7\. Monitoring, Logging & Analytics**

* **In-house metrics**

  * Track: category popularity, purchase conversion, geo-distribution  
    Yes, if it is easy to implement, Yes.

  * Use an event bus (e.g. Segment or self-hosted Kafka) to feed both GA4 and your own dashboards.  
    Yes, if it is easy to implement, Yes.

* **Error reporting**  
   Integrate Sentry (or similar) for front-end exceptions, plus structured logs on the back end.  
  Please, yes. Something that I can download log to show a developer or an AI developer for help in the future.

## **8\. CI/CD, Environments & Deployment**

Whatever will work here, again easy to implement and cost effective, please recommend and let’s do it. My answers will be based on this two things, please.

* **Staging vs. Production**

  * Mirror your IONOS setup in a staging instance for end-to-end QA by end of June.

* **Infrastructure as Code**  
   Terraform or Ansible scripts to spin up your VM, database, Redis instance, SSL certs (Let’s Encrypt), etc., so you can redeploy consistently.  
  OK, cool.

* **Database migrations**  
   Use a tool like Flyway or Liquibase to evolve your schema safely.

## **9\. Testing & Quality Assurance**

* **Automated tests**

  * Unit tests for game-logic (randomization, non-repeat behavior)

  * Integration tests for payment flows (using Stripe’s test webhooks)

* **End-to-end (E2E) tests**  
   Cypress or Playwright scripts covering key user journeys: sign-up → subscribe → play a game → timeout.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Review the gaps above**—let me know if anything surprises you or if you have extra requirements.

2. Once you’re comfortable, I’ll move on to **Stage 3**, where I’ll recommend the optimal frameworks (v0, Bolt, or alternatives), plus how to deploy on IONOS (or suggest better-suited hosts).

Feel free to ask for more detail on any point before we proceed\!
