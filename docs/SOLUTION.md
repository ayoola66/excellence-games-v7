# Game Creation Issue - Solution Guide

## Identified Issues

After thorough investigation, I've identified the following issues with the game creation functionality:

1. **Invalid API Token**: The current `STRAPI_ADMIN_TOKEN` in your environment is invalid or expired, resulting in 401 Unauthorized errors when making API requests to Strapi.

2. **Field Name Handling**: There was a minor issue with how the image field was handled. The frontend form uses `thumbnail` as the field name, but the Strapi schema expects `imageUrl`.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Generate a New API Token

The most critical issue is the invalid API token. You need to generate a new one:

```bash
# Run the create-strapi-token script with your Strapi admin credentials
node scripts/create-strapi-token.js your-admin-email your-admin-password
```

If this script doesn't work for any reason, you can manually create a token:

1. Log in to your Strapi admin panel at http://localhost:1337/admin
2. Go to Settings > API Tokens
3. Click "Create new API Token"
4. Fill in the details:
   - Name: NextJS Admin Token
   - Description: Token for NextJS admin dashboard
   - Token duration: Unlimited
   - Token type: Full access
5. Click "Save"
6. Copy the generated token
7. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   STRAPI_ADMIN_TOKEN=your-new-token
   ```

### 2. Test Your Token

After generating a new token, test it to make sure it works:

```bash
# Run the token test script
node scripts/test-token.js
```

This script will test if your token can:

- Get user information
- List games
- Create a test game
- Delete the test game

All tests should pass if your token is valid and has the correct permissions.

### 3. Code Fixes (Already Implemented)

I've already made the following code changes to fix the field name handling issue:

1. Updated `app/api/admin/games/route.ts` to:

   - Check for both `thumbnail` and `image` field names
   - Add more detailed logging for debugging
   - Improve error handling

2. Created testing scripts:
   - `scripts/test-token.js` - Tests if your API token is valid
   - `scripts/create-strapi-token.js` - Creates a new API token

### 4. Restart Your Servers

After updating your token:

1. Restart your Next.js server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. You may also want to restart your Strapi server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run develop
```

## Verifying the Fix

1. Log in to your Next.js admin dashboard
2. Go to Games
3. Click "Create New Game"
4. Fill in the details and submit
5. The game should be created successfully

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the Next.js server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that your Strapi server is running
3. Make sure your API token has full access permissions
4. Check that the permissions for the "Game" and "Category" content types are properly set in Strapi

## Permissions Check

Your permissions for both the Authenticated and Frontend_Admin roles look correct from the screenshots you provided. Both roles have all the necessary permissions for game and category management.

## Conclusion

The primary issue was an invalid API token. With a new valid token, the game creation functionality should work correctly. The code changes I've made ensure that the field name mismatch between the frontend and backend is handled properly.
