# **Next-Level Plan: Production-Ready Question Management System**

_Generated on: July 23, 2025_

## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a comprehensive 10-week roadmap to transform the current Question Management System from a functional admin tool into a production-ready platform capable of supporting live gameplay, advanced content management, and enterprise-level operations.

## **Current State Analysis**

### **What We Have (Strengths)**

- ✅ **Solid Foundation**: Next.js frontend + Strapi backend with robust architecture
- ✅ **Core Admin Features**: Complete CRUD operations for games, categories, and questions
- ✅ **Authentication System**: Token-based admin authentication with protected routes
- ✅ **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive dashboard built with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: CSV/XLSX upload functionality for question management
- ✅ **Basic Security**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, CSRF protection

### **Critical Gaps (What's Missing)**

- ❌ **Gameplay Functionality**: No mechanism to run live game sessions
- ❌ **Public API**: No endpoints for game clients to connect and play
- ❌ **Player Management**: No user roles or player authentication system
- ❌ **Real-time Features**: No live game state management or updates
- ❌ **Advanced Security**: Missing session management, token rotation, audit logging
- ❌ **Production Optimizations**: Performance bottlenecks, caching issues, file handling limits
- ❌ **Testing Coverage**: Insufficient automated testing for stability
- ❌ **Analytics**: No game statistics, player tracking, or performance metrics
