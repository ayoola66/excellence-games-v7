# Gap Analysis & Production Roadmap

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Question Management System, outlining its current state, identifying feature gaps, and presenting a prioritized roadmap to make it production-ready.

## 1. Application Overview

- **Purpose**: A specialized **Question Management System** designed to power two distinct game types: "Straight Games" (single question pool) and "Nested Games" (category-based questions).
- **Primary User**: An **Admin** who manages the entire lifecycle of games, categories, and questions through a dedicated dashboard.
- **Technology Stack**: The application is built on a modern stack, with a **Next.js** frontend consuming a **Strapi** headless CMS for the backend and admin panel.

## 2. Feature Gap Analysis

This analysis compares the features that are already implemented against those that are planned but missing.

### What You Have (Completed Features)

The application currently serves as a robust, admin-centric content management tool.

- **✅ Secure Authentication**: Admin login via NextAuth with protected routes.
- **✅ Game Management**: Full CRUD for games, including type selection (Straight/Nested) and status management.
- **✅ Category Management**: Full CRUD for categories used in Nested Games.
- **✅ Question Management**:
  - Full CRUD for individual questions.
  - Bulk upload via CSV and XLSX.
  - Search, filtering, and pagination.
- **✅ Modern UI/UX**: A responsive dashboard built with `shadcn/ui`, providing clear user feedback with toasts and loading states.

### The Gap (What It Needs)

The application is missing the entire user-facing and operational side required to run live games.

- **❌ User Management & Access Control**:

  - Users cannot manage their own profiles.
  - No activity logging to track changes.

- **❌ Core Gameplay Functionality**:

  - The system can store questions but has no mechanism to **run a game session**.
  - No real-time state management, score tracking, or game analytics.

- **❌ Advanced Content Features**:

  - The question editor is basic and lacks rich text or image support.
  - No system for versioning, tagging, or setting difficulty levels for questions.

- **❌ Integration & Extensibility**:
  - No public API for a game client (e.g., a mobile app) to connect to.
  - No webhook support for game events.
  - No functionality to export game data.

## 3. Roadmap to Production-Ready

This is a prioritized checklist of tasks to bridge the gap and prepare the application for launch.

### Priority 1: Implement Core Gameplay and User Roles

- [ ] **Design & Build Public API**: Create API endpoints for game clients to fetch games, start sessions, retrieve questions, and submit answers.
- [ ] **Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Strapi**:
  - [ ] Define and configure `Public` and `Authenticated` roles for API access (e.g., for `PLAYER` users).
  - [ ] Create custom Admin Panel roles like `Editor` to manage content with specific permissions.
- [ ] **Develop Game Session Logic**: Implement the state machine for a game (start, track current question, manage scores, end game).

### Priority 2: Enhance the Content Management Experience

- [ ] **Integrate a Rich Text Editor**: Replace the standard `textarea` for questions with a library like Tiptap or TinyMCE.
- [ ] **Add Image Support**: Allow questions to have associated images, including file handling and API updates.
- [ ] **Implement Question Tagging & Difficulty**: Add these fields to the `Question` model for more dynamic game creation.

### Priority 3: Add Analytics and Logging

- [ ] **Implement User Activity Logging**: Create a system to log important events (e.g., "User X updated Game Y") for auditing and debugging.
- [ ] **Create Game Statistics Dashboard**: Develop basic analytics to show game popularity, question difficulty, etc.

### Priority 4: Implement Automated Testing (Crucial for Stability)

- [ ] **Set up Unit & Component Testing**: Integrate **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to test individual components and functions.
- [ ] **Set up End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Use **Cypress** or **Playwright** to test critical user flows like logging in, creating a game, and uploading questions.

### Priority 5: Advanced & "Future-Proof" Features

- [ ] **Implement Webhooks**: Create a webhook system to notify external services about game events (e.g., "Game Finished").
- [ ] **Explore AI-Powered Tools**: Investigate using AI for generating question suggestions or analyzing question quality.
- [ ] **Add Data Export**: Allow admins to export game and question data in various formats (JSON, CSV).
