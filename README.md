## Authentication & Middleware

### Route Protection
- Admin routes (`/admin/*`) are protected by middleware
- Normal users are redirected to an "Access Denied" page when attempting to access admin routes
- Public routes and normal sign-in remain accessible at root level (`/`)

### Admin Authentication
- Token-based authentication system for admin access
- Configurable token lifetimes and refresh tokens
- Secure token generation and management
- See [Admin Authentication](./docs/admin-auth.md) for setup and usage details

### British English Policy
- All user-facing text throughout the application uses British English spelling
- This includes all UI elements, error messages, and documentation
- Contributors should maintain consistency with British English in all new features and updates

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Strapi v4 (Headless CMS)
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (for frontend), Strapi JWT (for backend)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **File Handling**: CSV (for Straight games) and XLSX (for Nested games) parsing (handled by custom logic)

## Getting Started

This project is structured with a separate frontend (Next.js) and backend (Strapi).

### Backend (Strapi)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. It will be configured for your database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
   ```
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   PORT=1337
   APP_KEYS=...
   API_TOKEN_SALT=...
   ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=...
   JWT_SECRET=...
   DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"

   # Admin Authentication
   ADMIN_TOKEN_LIFETIME=7d
   ADMIN_REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME=30d
   ADMIN_INITIAL_TOKEN=... # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
4. Start the Strapi server in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run develop
   ```
5. Access the Strapi admin panel at `http://localhost:1337/admin` and create your first admin user.

### Frontend (Next.js)

1. In a new terminal, navigate to the project root.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file with the following:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL="http://localhost:1337"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the admin dashboard.

## **Live Testing Feedback Plan**

### 1. **Step-by-Step Test Announcements**

- I‚Äôll announce each test as it begins (e.g., ‚ÄúTesting Strapi backend startup‚Ä¶‚Äù).
- I‚Äôll immediately report the result (‚úÖ Success, ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning, ‚ùå Error) for each test.

### 2. **Detailed Results**

- For each major area (backend, frontend, CRUD, login, dashboard, etc.), I‚Äôll provide:
  - What was tested
  - The outcome (pass/fail)
  - Any issues or errors found (with details)

### 3. **Summary Table**

- I‚Äôll maintain a running summary table in the chat, updating it as each test is completed.
